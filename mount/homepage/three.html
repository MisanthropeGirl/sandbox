        <p>The Mount is a family-orientated cricket club based in Southend-on Sea.</p>

        <p>We passionately believe in the importance of keeping Sunday cricket not just alive, but also vibrant, fun and competitive.</p>

        <p>The club maintains competitive standards on the field of play, alongside a welcoming approach to new players of all standards.</p>

        <p>We play our home games in a beautiful setting at Alleyn Court Prep School.</p>

        <p>The pitch, nets and pavilion are first-rate and the enclosed ground provides a safe and welcoming setting for supporters to come along and watch.</p>

        <p>We play most of our matches on Sundays over a combination of 40 and 30 overs per side, or traditional timed games.</p>

      <section class="c-intro-text">
        <p>We also recently introduced evening 20-20 matches into our fixture list and are always happy to look at new formats.</p>

        <p>This has resulted in an annual two-innings-per-side 20-20 ‘Test’ match, and popular shorter format tournaments that are generally six-a-side.</p>

        <p>It reflects our guiding considerations – to take on board the increasing time constraints on players, but balance this against an overriding desire to play competitive and compelling cricket.</p>
